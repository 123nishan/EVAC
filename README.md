The Problem: Evolve a Player for the Video Game Snake
Snake is a classic video game where the player controls a snake moving around a grid. In
each time-step the snake moves forward in the direction it is facing. The aim of the game is
for the snake to collect food that appears around the grid. Each food item increases the
score by one. The game is over if the snakeâ€™s head collides with its own body, collides with
the wall around the grid, or if it has been too long since the snake last ate. Each food item
eaten makes the snake longer, and thus the game becomes increasingly difficult.

 TASK -> Design and implement a coevolutionary algorithm in Python to create an agent to play this
game, with a population of snakes playing competing against a population of food positions
(or agents that place food).
